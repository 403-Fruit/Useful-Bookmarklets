# Useful-Firefox-Bookmarklets
Some bookmarklets I've written and found over the years. Tested on Firefox and Chrome. Should work with a few exceptions noted below.

## Installation

### Firefox
- Open Firefox's *Show All Bookmarks* window (Ctrl+Shift+B)

- In the *Import and Backup* menu, select *Import bookmarks from HTML...*

- Select the *exported_bookmarks.html* file

### Chrome

- Navigate to chrome://bookmarks/
- Click *Import Bookmarks* in the top right menu
- Select the *exported_bookmarks.html* file

## Bookmarklet descriptions

### Reverse Image (Google)

Reverse image search image at current location with Google

### Reverse Image (Yandex)

Reverse image search image at current location with Yandex.  
This is useful for searching people since Yandex image search uses facial recognition.

### Go Wayback

Search current URL on *The Wayback Machine* (View historical snapshots of page)

### Show FPS

Adds an FPS overlay in the top left corner of the page.

### Show/Hide Passwords

Toggles text visibility of password forms on current page.

### Translate Page

Opens Google Translated version of current page.

### Reddit Undelete

Opens a new window with ceddit and removeddit versions of current Reddit thread.  
Removeddit and ceddit show comments in a given thread that have been deleted or removed.  

Note: Doesn't work on chrome, you have to use the individual ceddit and removeddit bookmarklets.
